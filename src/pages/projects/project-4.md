## Overview

As the UX Designer and Developer for the "DESN LBRY" app, I led the refinement of a comprehensive design resource platform, created for the User Experience Design 3 class at Eastern Washington University. Initially a group project, I took ownership of optimizing the homepage and enhancing user interaction while retaining key elements from the collaborative effort. The app, crafted in Figma, provides designers with essential resources, offering interactive learning experiences through engaging tutorials and mini-quizzes. This project highlights my ability to merge educational content with intuitive, user-friendly design to create an engaging and functional resource for designers of all skill levels.

## Details

"DESN LBRY" was designed to provide an accessible, visually appealing platform for both novice and experienced designers. Using Figma, I developed a responsive and intuitive interface, balancing aesthetic appeal with functionality. The focus was on delivering concise, engaging tutorials paired with mini-quizzes to reinforce learning. A critical part of the process involved creating a comprehensive style guide that ensured consistency across the app. The educational content covered fundamental and advanced design topics, with a special focus on color theory, which I led the development of, ensuring the lessons were both informative and practical.
