## Overview

As the UX Designer and Developer for "It's Alive!", I crafted a unique virtual pet app as part of the User Experience Design 1 class. This project seamlessly integrates fitness and gamification by linking with Apple's fitness ecosystem, motivating users to stay active through the evolution of their virtual "ghost buddy." As users track their physical activity via the Apple Watch, their ghost buddy levels up, adding a fun and interactive element to their fitness journey. The app was developed with a focus on user engagement, motivational notifications, and customizable fitness challenges, all within a distinctive "spooky" aesthetic.

## Details

The app’s design began with thorough research, focusing on user personas and a competitive assessment of existing fitness and virtual pet apps. With this groundwork, I crafted a mobile-first, interactive experience that prioritizes user engagement and activity tracking through a gamified system. Using Figma for UI/UX design, Dalle for graphics, and Adobe Illustrator for refinement, the app was carefully crafted to ensure seamless Apple Watch connectivity and real-time user progress updates. The "It's Alive!" app embodies a bold visual theme of neon green and purple, creating an immersive experience that motivates users to stay fit and active while enjoying the spooky fun of evolving their virtual companion.
