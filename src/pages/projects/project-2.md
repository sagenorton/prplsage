## Overview

As the Front-End Developer for the Mahalo Promotions website, I led the creation of a pivotal online platform for a Spokane-based music promotions company. This project seamlessly combined web design and development to showcase music events and promote artists, delivering a functional and visually appealing online presence. My role involved crafting a site that meets the industry’s dynamic needs while ensuring it remains user-friendly and engaging. The mobile-first, minimalist design was tailored to the target audience’s heavy mobile usage, prioritizing content accessibility and ease of navigation. Through innovative custom coding, I brought the client’s vision to life with unique design elements and advanced functionalities.

## Details

The Mahalo Promotions website was designed with a clear focus on delivering a consistent and responsive experience across all devices. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I integrated custom features that enhanced the site's aesthetics and usability beyond standard templates. The minimalist approach ensured that the content took center stage, allowing users to effortlessly discover and navigate the site. Understanding the fast-paced nature of the music industry, I structured the site to be easily updated and maintained, providing the company with a robust platform that adapts to their evolving needs. This project stands as a testament to the successful integration of creative design with technical expertise, meeting both client expectations and industry standards.
