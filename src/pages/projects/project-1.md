## Overview

As Web Director, I led the creation of the 2023 Graphic Design Grad Show website, designed to attract viewers to the event and showcase the broader aspects of the show. The site highlighted not just the students' work but also the Graphic Design program, student club, sponsors, and unique collectibles. My focus was on creating an engaging online presence that encouraged attendance and participation. This project demonstrated my ability to craft a platform that captured the event’s full scope and appeal. The website played a crucial role in driving interest and engagement for the grad show.

## Details

The website was designed to align with the “3D” theme of the 2023 Graphic Design Grad Show, reflecting the creativity of the graduating class. Collaboration with students and instructors ensured the design resonated with the theme while maintaining clear navigation. The site effectively showcased the portfolios and emphasized the program’s broader offerings. My leadership ensured the website was both visually appealing and functional. The final product enticed visitors to explore the event and contributed to its overall success.

## Recognition

The website earned a Silver Addy Award at both the Spokane AAF and national levels for its success in showcasing the grad show. My leadership was further recognized with the Ascender Award, highlighting my role in design, development, and collaboration. The project exceeded expectations, creating a memorable experience for visitors and enhancing the event’s impact.
