## Overview

As the Content Creator for "Fowl Play: The Thanksgiving Escape Room," I helped lead a collaborative group project for the User Experience Design 3 class. Alongside my team, I developed an interactive escape room that combined physical and digital elements to immerse players in a comedic mystery set at a chaotic Thanksgiving dinner. My role focused on crafting the storyline, designing puzzles, and creating interactive features that challenged players to solve the case of the missing turkey. Together, we delivered a unique and engaging experience that seamlessly blended traditional gameplay with modern twists.

## Details

"Fowl Play" was designed to deliver a fully immersive experience using both physical game materials and digital components. The game revolved around the mystery of the missing Thanksgiving turkey, with players solving custom-made puzzles and uncovering clues through character cards and a digital social media feed called the "Gobble Feed." I worked closely with a talented team—Caden Davis (Team Leader), Emily Beer, Evan Sommerfeld, and Joey Sanchirico—to bring the concept to life. Using Adobe Illustrator and Figma, we created a player's guide, interactive social media feed, and character profiles to deepen the narrative and enhance engagement. The result was a fun, lighthearted game that kept players captivated from start to finish.
