## Overview

The Wildlife & Cultural Signs project for 49Â° North Mountain Resort, in collaboration with the Kalispel and Spokane Tribes, started as a class assignment and developed into a professional freelance opportunity. The project aimed to create educational signage to be placed along the resort's trails, offering visitors insights into the local wildlife and the native tribes of the area. My role involved designing animal characters that would engage and educate visitors, with a particular focus on incorporating the Salish languages of the Kalispel and Spokane Tribes alongside English. The result was a visually appealing and culturally enriching experience that integrated seamlessly into the natural environment of the mountain resort.

## Details

This project centered around the creation of 15 unique animal characters, each labeled in English and the Salish languages of the Kalispel and Spokane Tribes. These signs were designed to be placed on wooden posts along the mountain's trails, with engraved names and natural elements incorporated into the design. Adobe Illustrator and Procreate were used to create intricate and engaging graphics that aligned with the overall aesthetic of the mountain environment. In addition to the individual animal signs, I also designed a larger informational sign that included tribal logos, explanatory text, and selected animal characters, further enhancing the educational value of the project. The final product was both functional and visually compelling, fulfilling the educational goals of the resort and the tribes.
