        <h6>
            Hi, Iâ€™m Sage! A Front-End Developer whoâ€™s passionate about building digital experiences that are intuitive, engaging, and fun to use. I love blending clean design with purposeful code, whether thatâ€™s refining a layout, adding subtle interactivity, or solving complex logic challenges. My background spans web design, UX/UI, animation, and game design, and Iâ€™ve led projects like the award-winning SFCC Grad Show website, a mobile-first site for Mahalo Promotions, and a custom trucking logistics calculator. Iâ€™m always driven by the balance of creativity and problemsolving. Outside of work, Iâ€™m a Nintendo fan, EDM festival-goer, and proud cat parent to four. I bring curiosity, focus, and a little bit of weird to every project I take on.
