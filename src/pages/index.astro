            Hey there! Iâ€™m Sage â€“ a Front-End Developer whoâ€™s all about creating digital experiences that feel smooth, engaging, and fun to use. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to design, but what really excites me is bringing it to life through code. Whether itâ€™s refining a layout, adding subtle animations, or solving a tricky functionality issue, I love the challenge of making websites both beautiful and intuitive. My mind is always buzzing with ideasâ€”whether itâ€™s a fresh approach to a UI, a way to optimize performance, or a creative solution to a coding puzzle.
        <br><br>
            My background spans web design & development, UX/UI, animation, and game design. Iâ€™ve had the chance to work on some exciting projects, like leading the award-winning SFCC 2023 Graphic Design Grad Show website, designing a mobile-first site for Mahalo Promotions that took user engagement to the next level, and building a custom trucking logistics calculator to streamline cost efficiency. I love tackling projects that blend technical problem-solving with creativity to make functional, engaging experiences.
        <br><br>
            At the end of the day, I build because I love creating things that people enjoy using. Iâ€™m a Nintendo enthusiast, EDM festival fan, and cat parent, and those passions fuel my creativity every day. Whether Iâ€™m coding a slick new feature or fine-tuning a user experience, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make digital spaces feel just a little more intuitive, interactive, and fun.
