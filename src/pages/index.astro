            Hi, Iâ€™m Sage! Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer who focuses on crafting digital experiences that feel intuitive and engaging. I love combining clean design with purposeful code to make interfaces that are easy to use and visually thoughtful. Whether Iâ€™m refining layouts, building interactivity, or solving logic puzzles in code, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve how things work and feel. Creative thinking and problem-solving go hand in hand for me, and that balance is what keeps me excited about what I do.
            <br><br>
            You could describe me as a purple-haired crazy cat lady who loves all things horror and Nintendo. I enjoy long walks around any EDM festival and my guility pleasures are energy drinks, candy, pasta and whiskey.
